# Investment and Trading
## Machine Learning for Stock Market Investing
This project, consists on building a stock price predictor that takes daily trading data over a certain date range as input, and outputs projected estimates for given query dates. Note that the inputs will contain multiple metrics, such as opening price (Open), highest price the stock traded at (High), how many stocks were traded (Volume) and closing price adjusted for stock splits and dividends (Adjusted Close); your system only needs to predict the Adjusted Close price.

### Data
There are several open sources for historical stock price data which you are free to use:

Yahoo! Finance: You can directly query for a stock through the web API, or download a dump of .csv files and use them.
Bloomberg API: Multiple APIs available, including Python.
Quandl: Also multiple APIs, including Python.

Look for an API endpoint/library function that lets you obtain daily stock values such as Open, High, Low, Close, Volume and Adjusted Close. Remember that Adjusted Close is what you are trying to predict.
